Currently, the cars are just moving in a loop(One can notice the color pattern).

I'd like to get the cars removed and new ones to be created
as the older ones are removed.
But currently this is too much and is acceptable for the SCHOOL PROJECT.

So, we shall end it here but might add some minor changes, like splitting the code into different files/modules.

1. Graphical animation with a start button?
2. Timer? idk maybe not.
3. Game Over/You Win! screen
