This is the Pygame project I submitted in 2016.
Being a newbie in Python, I learnt a lot from Pygame during the period of it's development. I'd like to thank those people on webistes and forums where I asked cleared my doubts.
This is a simple game where a sheep has to cross a road.
There's another folder which has some test codes I made or samples I tried during the development.
The main program is in "The Game" folder.
